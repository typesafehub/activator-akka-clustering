		<h2>Run the Application</h2>

		<p>
			This tutorial will demonstrate a chat room application. Chat users
			communicate with <a
				href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern"
				target="_blank">publish-subscribe</a> to other users somewhere in
			the cluster.
		</p>

		<p>
			Open the <a href="#run" class="shortcut">Run</a> tab. On the
			left-hand side we can see the console output, which is logging output
			from nodes joining the cluster and the fictive chat users publishing
			random Scott Adams quotes to the chat room as illustrated with the
			<code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> markers. Other chat users in the room
			receive those messages as illustrated by the <code>&lt;&lt;</code>
			markers.
		</p>

		<h2>Explore the Code - Startup</h2>

		<p>
			Let's look at the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/chat/Main.scala"
				class="shortcut">Main.scala</a> file.
		</p>

		<p>
			The application starts in the <code>main</code> method. Normally you
			would run cluster nodes in separate JVMs, typically on different physical
			machines. Here we simulate that by starting 3 separate actor systems in
			the same JVM. The actor systems	use remoting to communicate with each other,
			so the code would be the same for a real distributed application.
		</p>

		<p>
			The configuration of the actor systems is located in <a
				href="#code/src/main/resources/application.conf" class="shortcut">application.conf</a>.
			The
			<code>ClusterActorRefProvider</code>
			is the only mandatory configuration to enable Akka clustering.
		</p>
		<p>
			<code>port=0</code>
			means that the remoting of each actor system will listen on a random
			available port. This is important when running several actor systems
			on the same host, since they cannot bind to the same port.
		</p>

		<p>A few chat user actors are created in each actor system.</p>

		<p>To form a cluster the nodes must join some other node in the
			cluster. The first node joins itself, the other 2 nodes join the
			first node.</p>

		<p>
			Note that there is a delay between the startup of each actor system
			and that explains why the first messages are not delivered to Miguel
			and Tyler. An Akka cluster is elastic in its nature. Nodes may join
			and exit over time and that is discovered by other members of the
			cluster. Go through the log output in the <a href="#run"
				class="shortcut">Run</a> tab again and make sure you see that the 3
			nodes become members. Look for "Member is Up". If the log has grown too
			much you can restart the app.
		</p>

		<h2>Explore the Code - Chat Client Actor</h2>

		<p>
			Let's look at the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/chat/RandomUser.scala"
				class="shortcut">RandomUser.scala</a> file.
		</p>


		<p>
			The <code>RandomUser</code> simulates a chat user. It schedules a
			<code>Tick</code> message to itself with a random interval. For each tick
			it picks a Scott Adams quote and publishes it to the chat room via the
			<code>ChatClient</code>, which is a child actor to <code>RandomUser</code>.
		</p>



		<p>
			Open the <a href="#code/src/main/scala/chat/ChatClient.scala" class="shortcut">ChatClient.scala</a>
			file.
		</p>

		<p>
			The	<code>ChatClient</code> receives <code>Publish</code> messages from the
			<code>RandomUser</code>	and sends those to the chat room topic via the
			<code>DistributedPubSubMediator</code>. It subscribes to the same topic to
			receive messages from itself and other chat users. Note that the chat users
			are completely decoupled from each other and only know about the publish-subscribe
			topic that is managed by the mediator. The sender of the message is still the
			original sender, which makes it possible to reply directly to that actor.
		</p>

		<p>
			<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/contrib/distributed-pub-sub.html"
			target="_blank"><code>DistributedPubSubMediator</code></a> facilitates this
			publish-subscribe communication pattern. It is built on top of Akka cluster and packaged in the
			<a href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/contrib/index.html" target="_blank">Akka Contrib Module</a>.
			The mediator actor keeps track of registered subscribers, but there is no central
			broker. One mediator actor is running on each node, and it replicates the actor
			references to peer mediators at other cluster members. This distributed registry
			is eventually consistent, i.e. changes are not immediately visible at other nodes,
			but typically they will be fully replicated to all other nodes after a few seconds.
		</p>

		<h2>Cluster Membership</h2>

		<p>
			Discovery of new nodes in the cluster, as well as detection of
			unreachable and removed nodes, is important to be able to build
			cluster aware features, such as the <code>DistributedPubSubMediator</code>.
			The API for cluster membership is event based.
		</p>

		<p>
			The <a href="#code/src/main/scala/chat/MemberListener.scala" class="shortcut">MemberListener.scala</a>
			illustrates how to subscribe to such cluster membership events and
			keep track of addresses of the current members in the cluster.
		</p>

		<p>
			A snapshot of the full state, <code>CurrentClusterState</code>, is sent to the subscriber as
			the first event. Here we are only interested in members with status <code>Up</code> and grab the
			<code>Address</code> of those members. When there are changes to the members of the cluster
			other events are sent to the subscriber. <code>MemberUp</code> is received when
			a new member is added to the cluster. <code>MemberRemoved</code> is received when a member
			is removed from the cluster due to graceful exit or failure.
		</p>

		<p>
			Using the <code>Address</code> information you can send messages to actors at those nodes.
		</p>
		<pre>
			<code>
  import akka.actor.RootActorPath
  val service = context.actorSelection(RootActorPath(member.address) /
    "user" / "backendService")
  service ! Request("..")
</code>
		</pre>

		<h2>Next Steps</h2>

		<p>
			With the presented <a
				href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/contrib/distributed-pub-sub.html"
				target="_blank">publish-subscribe feature</a> and brief understanding of <a
				href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/cluster-usage.html#Subscribe_to_Cluster_Events"
				target="_blank">cluster membership</a> you can develop applications
			that scale out. Of course there are more things in Akka cluster to
			take advantage of, such as <a
				href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/scala/cluster-usage.html#Cluster_Aware_Routers"
				target="_blank">Cluster Aware Routers</a> and the <a
				href="http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.2.0/contrib/cluster-singleton.html#cluster-singleton"
				target="_blank">Cluster Singleton</a>.
